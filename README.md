# Clustering synthesized data using BFR with PySpark

Applied the BFR algorithm for clustering points in euclidean space using PySpark for large-scale distributed processing.
More than 3 million points were clustered. Initial centers were chosen using k-means++.
A _normalized mutual information_ score of 0.999 was achieved.
